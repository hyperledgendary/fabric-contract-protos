# fabric-ledger-protos

Prototype gRPC contract and ledger APIs, loosely based on the Hyperledger Fabric [Ledger API RFC](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-rfcs/pull/16).

The messages are currently being used to serialise data between waPC host and guest in the [Wasm Smart Contract RFC](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-rfcs/pull/28) prototype.
